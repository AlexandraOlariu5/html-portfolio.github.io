    <li><a href="https://www.photoshopessentials.com/essentials/image-resolution/"><h2>Photoshop essentials</h2></a></li>
    <p>This website has great information on images, Photoshop, pixels and web design. What I like the most is the approach of the writer,
        Robert Stevenson. It helped me understand what pixels are, that the resolution only controls the way an image it is printed and not
        the way it appears on the web or the myth of the 72 ppi and even how to choose the best camera, based on my needs.

    <li><a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article"><h2>Simpli learn</h2></a></li>
    <p>I came across this fascinating website recently, while looking for the last trends in the tech industry and the jobs we should keep
        an eye on as they comes in demand at the speed of light. This website offers much more than this already comprehensive article, such
        as courses and tutorials as it hosts the World #1 Online Bootcamp.

    <li><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/common/christmas-eve"><h2>Time and date</h2></a></li>
